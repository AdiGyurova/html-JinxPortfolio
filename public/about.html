<p>I am the best dog ever. My name is Jinx. My human
  found me on the street and took me home. We live together
  for seven years. I don't know when is my birtday, but my human
  celebrates it on the day she found me - 9th October. I have
  a brother - Dante. I like to bully him alot, but just for fun - 
  I always protect him from other dogs and cats, and from the 
  vacuum cleaner...
